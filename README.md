The following repo contains the lab work for the course "Big Data Analytics" (732A54) in the Statistics and Machine Learning division at Linköping University.

The labs were coded using PySpark via Sigma which is a 110-node HPC cluster funded by and dedicated to Linköping University students, for more information: https://www.nsc.liu.se/systems/sigma/
The necessary analysis was then ported to a pdf to create a report.
